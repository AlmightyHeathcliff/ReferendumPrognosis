In recent years, social media streams have represented vast amounts of insightful information that can be used by organisations and users to understand trends and usersâ€™ perceptions and help in making informed decisions. There is an increasing research and development trend toward developing algorithms and tools to analyse such data and support organisations and users alike in developing and delivering better services to customers or use the information to themselves. In this research-in-progress report, we have proposed a model for analyzing Twitter data. An initial prototype was developed as a web-based application that allows users to search for specific terms on Twitter; the retrieved results are presented and visualised using the forms of a) a interactive web pages, using different JS and CSS, and b) bar graphs. This initial prototype will represent the core engine of our project and sentiment social media analysis.
